# Kubernetes

## API Primitives 
Get information about Kubernetes objects
```bash
kubectl get <object>
kubectl get pods 
kubectl get nodes 
```
* Spec defines the requested state of an object (yaml) 
* State: the actual state which not necessarily matches the spec 

* Print spec and status in yaml format: `kubectl get nodes $node_name -o yaml`
* Information about the object: `kubectl describe node $node_name`

## Pods 
Runs one or more container. Typically only a single container per pod. See multi container pods
Example yaml for a pod: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1 
kind: Pod 
metadata: 
  name: my-pod 
  labels: 
    app: myapp 
spec: 
  containers: 
  - name: myapp-container 
    image: busybox 
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600'] 
```
The yaml file creates a pod with a single container based on the busybox image. You can specify a command that overrides the default command of the container image. 

Create a pod from the yaml definition file: `kubectl create -f my-pod.yml`
 
Edit a pod by updating the yaml definiton and re-applying it: `kubectl apply -f my-pod.yml`
 
You can also edit a pod like this with the linux default editor: `kubectl edit pod my-pod`
 
You can delete a pod like this: `kubectl delete pod my-pod`

Connect to shell of running container: `kubectl exec -it my-pod -- /bin/sh`

Execute command in the container: `kubectl exec my-pod -- ls`

Get the container's logs: `kubectl logs counter`

For a multi-container pods you have to specify the container with the -c flag: `kubectl logs <pod name> -c <container name>`

It is possible to download the pod spec. Useful if edit doesn't work and the pod has to be recreated: `kubectl get pod nginx -n nginx-ns -o yaml --export > nginx-pod.yml`

## Namespaces 

Separates applications or teams within the same cluster. If you don't specify a namespace, the object gets created in the default namespace. 

You can get a list of the namespaces in the cluster like this: `kubectl get namespaces`

You can also create your own namespaces: `kubectl create ns my-ns`

If the namespace is not defined, only the pods in the default namespace are listed: `kubectl get pods -n my-ns` 

 
## Config Maps 

Config maps contain configurations that are common to all containers in the cluster. Config Maps contain key-value pairs that either can be access directly or can be mounted to the filesystem of the container. 

Create config map in the cluster: `kubectl create -f my-config-map-pod.yml`

Config map example: 
```yaml
apiVersion: v1 
kind: ConfigMap 
metadata: 
   name: my-config-map 
data: 
   myKey: myValue 
   anotherKey: anotherValue 
```

Access config map in container spec with environment variable: 
```yaml
spec: 
  containers: 
  - name: myapp-container 
    image: busybox 
    command: ['sh', '-c', "echo $(MY_VAR) && sleep 3600"] 
    env: 
    - name: MY_VAR 
      valueFrom: 
        configMapKeyRef: 
          name: my-config-map 
          key: myKey 
```
It is also possible to mount the config map to the file system of the container. Each key from the config map is a file: 
```yaml
spec: 
  containers: 
  - name: myapp-container 
    image: busybox 
    command: ['sh', '-c', "echo (cat /etc/config/myValue) && sleep 3600"] 
    volumeMounts: 
      - name: config-volume 
        mountPath: /etc/config 
  volumes: 
    - name: config-volume 
      configMap: 
        name: my-config-map 
```

## Security Context 
Commands/processes inside the container run as root user by default. If a mounted file from the node is accessed inside the container, the file is access with root user rights. If we want to run a container with the right of a specific user or group, we can specify this in the container spec. 

Access the file with the rights of the user identified by id 2001 
```yaml
spec: 
  securityContext: 
    runAsUser: 2001 
    fsGroup: 3001 
  containers: 
  - name: myapp-container 
    image: busybox 
    command: ['sh', '-c', "cat /message/message.txt && sleep 3600"] 
```

## Resources 
If a pod is created, the node scheduler selects the node based on the requested resources in the container spec. If the specified limits are reached, the pod will be evicted.

### CPU
Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in cpu units. One cpu, in Kubernetes, is equivalent to:
* AWS vCPU
* GCP Core
* Hyperthread on a bare-metal Intel processor with Hyperthreading

0.5 means half a CPU. 0.1 is equivalent to the expression 100m. 

### Memory
Limits and requests for memory are measured in bytes. 128Mi means 128 mega byte memory.

Example

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-contaianer
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600']
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```
Resource usage can be checked with the top command
```bash
kubectl top pods
kubectl top pod my-pod
kubectl top pods -n my-namespace
kubectl top nodes
```

## Secrets 
Used to store sensitive information such as passwords and access tokens. The format is similar to config maps. 
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
stringData:
  myKey: myPassword
```
Access in container spec: 
```yaml
spec: 
  containers: 
  - name: myapp-container 
    image: busybox 
    command: ['sh', '-c', "echo Hello, Kubernetes! && sleep 3600"] 
    env: 
    - name: MY_PASSWORD 
      valueFrom: 
        secretKeyRef: 
          name: my-secret 
          key: myKey 
```

## Liveness and Readiness Probes
### Livness
Indicates whether the container is running. If the liveness probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, and the container is subjected to its restart policy.

Livness probe with command
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', "echo Hello, Kubernetes! && sleep 3600"]
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - echo
        - testing
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
```

### Readiness
Indicates whether the container is ready to service requests. If the readiness probe fails, the endpoints controller removes the Podâ€™s IP address from the endpoints of all services. 

Readiness HTTP probe
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: nginx
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
```

## Labels and Annotations
Kubernetes labels provide a way to attach custom, identifying information to your objects. Selectors can then be used to filter objects using label data as criteria
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-development-label-pod
  labels:
    app: my-app
    environment: development
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```
You can use selectors to query pods
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=my-app
kubectl get pods -l environment=production
kubectl get pods -l environment=development
kubectl get pods -l environment!=production
kubectl get pods -l 'environment in (development,production)'
kubectl get pods -l app=my-app,environment=production
```

## Deployments
Deployments can be used to manage a group of replica sets (pods).
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
* spec.replica: the number of pods that are going to be created
* spec.template: describes the pods that will be created
* spec.selector: selects the templates that are managed by this deployment

For each replica a pod with its own ip address gets created. That's how it is possible to expose same container port multiple time.
```bash
# show pods ip 
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx -o yaml | grep podIP

# access port 80 on specific pod (ssh into node in cluster)
curl 10.40.0.7:80
```

You can mange deployments like any other object in Kubernetes
```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get deployment <deployment_name>
kubectl describe deployment <deployment_name>
kubectl edit deployment <deployment_name>
kubectl delete deployment <deployment_name>
```

### Rolling deployment
1. create the deployment: `kubectl apply -f rolling-deployment.yml`
2. change the image of a deployment: `kubectl set image deployment/rolling-deployment nginx=nginx:1.7.9 --record`
3. check the status of the update: `kubectl rollout status deployment/rolling-deployment`
3. show the history of the deployment: `kubectl rollout history deployment/rolling-deployment`
4. show details about a specif version: `kubectl rollout history deployment/rolling-deployment --revision=2`
5. rollback to a previous version: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/rolling-deployment`

You can define the strategy for the rolling deployment in the deployment spec
```yaml
spec:
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 3
      maxUnavailable: 2
```
* spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable: maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during update
* .spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge: max number of additional pods that can be created during the update

## Service
Services provide a way to access dynamically create pods. 
If a deployment creates multiple containers with the same port, a service routs the network traffic from a single port to the dynamically created pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 80
```

* spec.type ClusterIP: routes the traffic inside the cluster to the target ports of the pods. ClusterIP can only be access inside the cluster.
* spec.ports.port: the port where the service listening on
* spec.ports.targetPort: the ports exposed by the container

`curl <service-ip>:8080` equal to `curl <pod-ip>:80`

If the selector of the service selects multiple pods, ClusterIP uses round robin/random to forward the traffic.

```bash
# show all services
kubectl get service

# show the endpoints of the service
kubectl get endpoints my-servic
``` 

### Service type
* ClusterIP: only reachable within the cluster.
* NodePort: exposes the port on each nodes ip. 
  `nginx-svc    NodePort    10.43.240.110   <none>        3000:30743/TCP   3s    app=nginx`
  Within the cluster the NodePort service can be reached at 3000. If accessed trough the node itself at port 30743 (e.g. ssh to vm and then localhost:30743)


## Jobs and Cronjobs
* Jobs provide a way in Kubernetes to start a pod once and run it until completion
* Cronjobs are similar to unix cron jobs. They start a pod in a specific interval

```bash
kubectl get jobs
kubectl get cronjobs
```

## Network Policy
By default, pods are not isolated and accept traffic from any source. Network policies provide a way to restrict traffic to certain pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: secure-app
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          allow-access: "true"
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          allow-access: "true"
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

* Ingress: Accept only incoming traffic from pods with the 'allow-access' label on port 80
* Egress: Allow only outgoing traffic to pods with the 'allow-access' label on port 80

## Volumes
Volumes can be mounted to containers, for instance if two containers want to share data.
If a container is restarted, the volume persists.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    name: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do mkdir /tmp/storage; echo 'hello world' > /tmp/storage/hello.txt; sleep 3600; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /tmp/storage
      name: my-volume
  volumes:
  - name: my-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```
The empty dir volume is created on the node if the pod gets assigned to it the first time. If the pod is removed, the directory gets also removed.

* spec.volumes: defines a empty directory outside the container
* spec.containers.volumeMounts: defines which directory inside the container is mounted externally

### Persistent Volume
Persistent volumes are not associated with a specific pod. They are usually created by the admin and back by physical storage provided by the cloud service.
```yaml
kind: PersistentVolume
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-pv
spec:
  storageClassName: local-storage
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```
The storageClassName can be any string

Pods can access PersistentVolumes through Claims. The claim request a specifc storage class and size.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: local-storage
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 512Mi
```

A Pod uses the PersistentVolumeClaim to mount storage
```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-pvc-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 3600; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: "/mnt/storage"
      name: my-storage
  volumes:
  - name: my-storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: my-pvc
```
